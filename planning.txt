1. add technical attributes for all tables
-- create ingestion for fact table 
2. think about how to integrate unit tests and maybe visualize with allure
3. create diagrams for the conceptual model and logical model -- probably draw.io and then pgadmin for the physical layer
4. think about whether to use Inmon or Kimball for the reporting part
5. ETL pipeline architecture considerations -- SQL files and procedures vs Python files
6. OS differences and how to use Airflow (WSL or Docker, database on Windows or on Linux) -- probably going with WSL Airflow connected to Windows Postgres -- which means more networking effort but I dont get fucked by Linux 
7.



-- research GitHub actions + AWS RDS db for cloud-like automation
