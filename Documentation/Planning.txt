What do I need the database to have? Listing requirements:
1. I need to see all the facts such as: 
  a. how many sets, reps, weight(resistance) has been lifted per exercise per day 
  b. a table with all the exercises with maybe some attributes like (id, name, compound/isolated, resistance type, etc.)  
   c. a table with all the muscles I train 
    b and c. a bridge table which will link exercises to muscles for data visualization and graphics (also for the bridge table add a flag with role as primary muscle or secondary muscle, very useful later) 
  d. a table with times (like a dimension)
  e. a table with resistance types (another M-M relationship I found with exercises woo this is getting more complex) 
  f. exercise_variation which is not a bridge table but helps group exercises
  g. granularity level of the fact table can be per sets as each set can have different rep numbers and different resistance levels
