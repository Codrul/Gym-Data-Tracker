# Gym Data Tracker

> ## Project Scope
> 
> This project wants to create a data pipeline which extracts data from Google Sheets, passes it through a database for
> storage and uses a dimensional
> layer to create real-time Power BI visuals.



> ## Chapter 1: _Data Modeling_
> The first step was to get the required data. Before starting 
> to track workouts I needed to think about how 
> I will have my data structured in my DB. 
> I wanted to get straight into writing SQL,
> but I knew it would get messy along the way.
> So I started by creating a conceptual model for my 
> data warehouse.
