What do I need the database to have? Listing requirements:
1. I need to see all the facts such as: 
  a. how many sets, reps, weight(resistance) has been lifted per exercise per day 
  b. a table with all the exercises with maybe some attributes like (id, name, compound/isolated, resistance type, etc.)  
   c. a table with all the muscles I train 
    b and c. a bridge table which will link exercises to muscles for data visualization and graphics 
  d. a table with times (like a dimension)
